Micro & Nano druid, for E2E tests
=======================================

Dockerfiles to run nano and micro setups of [druid](https://github.com/apache/druid) for e2e tests. Some configurations are applied to maximize the response time of the Druid docker but should in no way refer to a production cluster.

Arguments
---------

Arguments that can be set while building:
- `DRUID_VERSION`: 0.20.1 by default

Building

Every time a `^[0-9.]+` tag is pushed, two docker images `micro-{tag}` and `micro-{tag}` are built and published [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wiremind/mino-druid).
